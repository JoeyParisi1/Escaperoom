<h2 id='description'>Description</h2>

<p>WE NEED YOUR HELP! Please come quick into the pyramid. We have lost our most expirenced explorer and haven't made contact with him in over 3 hours! We have to start at the top of the pyramid and make our way down, as least that what he told us to do. There is a series of puzzles that is needed in order to reach the center and find the mystery of Omari. There has only been rumors to what power this mystery may hold and I am afraid that Will (the explorer) may have been victim to something related to this mystery </p>

     <p>This is it, you traveled on boat for 2 months. From the docks at New York, to Spain, and finally to Giza, Egypt. You stand there, with the pyramids towering over you. "It's time to start climbing" says Ronnie. You take your first steps and hope that you'll be able to make it back......  </p>
